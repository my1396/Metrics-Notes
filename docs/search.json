    "text": "In modeling the response of economic variables to policy stimuli, it is expected that there will be possibly long lags between policy changes and their impacts. The length of lag between changes in monetary policy and its impact on important economic variables such as output and investment has been a subject of analysis for several decades.\nEither the dependent variable or one of the independent variables is based on expectations. Expectations about economic events are usually formed by aggregating new information and past experience. Thus, we might write the expectation of a future value of variable \\(x\\), formed this period, as\n\\[\n  x_t = \\E_t [x^*_{t+1} \\mid z_t, x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \\ldots] = g(z_t, x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \\ldots) .\n  \\]\nFor example, forecasts of prices and income enter demand equations and consumption equations.\nCertain economic decisions are explicitly driven by a history of related activities.For example, energy demand by individuals is clearly a function not only of current prices and income, but also the accumulated stocks of energy using capital. Even energy demand in the macroeconomy behaves in this fashion–the stock of automobiles and its attendant demand for gasoline is clearly driven by past prices of gasoline and automobiles. Other classic examples are the dynamic relationship between investment decisions and past appropriation decisions and the consumption of addictive goods such as cigarettes and theater performances.",

Maximum value at 0 lag.\n\\(\\gamma (h)\\) is symmetric, i.e., \\(\\gamma (-h) = \\gamma (h)\\)\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Autocorrelation\nThe autocorrelation function (ACF) is given by\n\\[\n{\\color{#337ab7} \\rho(h) = \\frac{\\gamma (h)}{\\gamma (0)} = \\rho^h },\n\\] which is simply the correlation between \\(\\varepsilon_{t+h}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{t}\\,.\\)\nThe autocorrelation of the stationary AR(1) 17.3 is a simple geometric decay (\\(\\abs{\\rho}&lt;1\\)):\n\nIf \\(\\abs{\\rho}\\) is small, the autocorrelations decay rapidly to zero with \\(h\\)\nIf \\(\\abs{\\rho}\\) is large (close to unity), then the autocorrelations decay moderately\nThe AR(1) parameter \\(\\abs{\\rho}\\) describes the persistence in the time series\n\nNote that \\(\\rho(h)\\) satisfies the recursion \\[\n\\rho(h) = \\rho\\cdot \\rho(h-1) \\,.\n\\]\n\nFor \\(\\rho &gt;0\\), \\(\\rho(h)=\\rho^h&gt;0\\) observations close together are positively correlated with each other. The larger the \\(\\rho\\), the larger the correlation.\nFor \\(\\rho &lt;0\\), the sign of the ACF \\(\\rho(h)=\\rho^h\\) depends on the time interval.\n\nWhen \\(h\\) is even, \\(\\rho(h)\\) is positive;\nwhen \\(h\\) is odd, \\(\\rho(h)\\) is negative.\n\nThis result means that observations at contiguous time points are negatively correlated, but observations two time points apart are positively correlated.\n\nFor example, if an observation, \\(\\varepsilon_t\\), is positive, the next observation, \\(\\varepsilon_{t+1}\\), is typically negative, and the next observation, \\(\\varepsilon_{t+2}\\), is typically positive. Thus, in this case, the sample path is very choppy.\n\n\nAnother interpretation of \\(\\rho(h)\\) is the optimal weight for scaling \\(\\varepsilon_t\\) into \\(\\varepsilon_{t+h}\\), i.e., the weight, \\(a\\), that minimizes \\(E[(\\varepsilon_{t+h} - a\\,\\varepsilon_{t})^2]\\,.\\)",

    "text": "6.2 Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve\nExample 12.3 in Greene (2003), 5ed, Econometric Analysis.\nA linear version of the expectations augmented Phillips curve can be written as\n\\[\ninf_t - inf^e_t = \\beta_1 (unem_t - \\mu_0) + e_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_0\\) is the natural rate of unemployment, which we assume constant over time, and \\(inf^e_t\\) is the expected rate of inflation formed in year \\(t-1.\\)\nThe difference between actual unemployment and the natural rate is called cyclical unemployment, while the difference between actual and expected inflation is called unanticipated inflation.\nIf there is a tradeoff between unanticipated inflation and cyclical unemployment, then \\(\\beta_1&lt;0.\\)\nThe error term, \\(e_t\\), is called a supply shock by macroeconomists.\nTo complete this model, we need to make an assumption about inflationary expectations. Under adaptive expectations, the expected value of current inflation depends on recently observed inflation. A particularly simple formulation is that expected inflation this year is last year’s inflation:\n\\[\ninf^e_t = inf_{t-1}\n\\]\nUnder this assumption, we can write the following empirical model:\n\\[\ninf_t - inf_{t-1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\,unem_t  + e_t,\n\\] or\n\\[\n\\Delta  inf_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\,unem_t  + e_t,\n\\] where \\(\\Delta  inf_t = inf_t - inf_{t-1}\\) and \\(\\beta_0=-\\beta_1\\mu_0.\\)\nHence, the natural unemployment rate can be obtained by:\n\\[\n\\mu_0 = -\\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_1}.\n\\]\n\nlm_phillips_aug &lt;- lm(delta_infl ~ unemp, data = data %&gt;% tail(-2))\nsummary(lm_phillips_aug)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = delta_infl ~ unemp, data = data %&gt;% tail(-2))\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-11.2791  -1.6635  -0.0117   1.7813   8.5472 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

But the effect is statistically insignificant.\nUnder expectations augmented Phillips Curve, one-point increase in \\(unem\\) lowers unanticipated inflation by about 0.1 of a point. We can contrast this with the static Phillips curve in Equation 6.1, where we found a positive relationship between inflation and unemployment.\nThe natural employment rate is 5.78 percent.\n\\[\n\\mu_0 = -\\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_1} = \\frac{0.49}{0.09} \\approx 5.44\n\\]\nVariance can be obtained by the Delta Method.

Two leading candidates for failure are\n\nomitted variables and\nmeasurement error in some of the regressors.\n\nOther more subtle causes:\n\nLagged effects\nEither the dependent variable of one of the independent variables is based on expectation.\n\n\nExample 10.1 For example, consider a static model to explain a city’s murder rate (\\(mrdrte_t\\)) in terms of police officers per capita (\\(polpc_t\\)):\n\\[\nmrdrte_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\, polpc_t + u_t.\n\\]\nSuppose that the city adjusts the size of its police force based on past values of the murder rate, such as\n\\[\npolpc_{t+1} = \\delta_0 + \\delta_1 mrdrte_t + v_t.\n\\]\nThis means that, say, \\(polpc_{t+1}\\) might be correlated with \\(u_t\\) (since a higher \\(u_t\\) leads to a higher \\(mrdrte_t\\)). If this is the case, strict exogeneity is violated.\nMathematically,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\E [u_t polpc_{t+1}] &= \\E [u_t (\\delta_0 + \\delta_1 mrdrte_t + v_t)] \\\\\n&= \\delta_1 \\E[u_t\\, mrdrte_t] \\\\\n&= \\delta_1 \\E[u_t (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\, polpc_t + u_t)] \\\\\n&= \\delta_1 \\E[u_t^2] \\\\\n&= \\delta_1 \\sigma^2_u.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nExample 10.2 A general representation with two explanatory variables:\n\\[\ny_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1z_{t1} + \\beta_2z_{t2} + u_t.\n\\] Under weak dependence, the condition sufficient for consistency of OLS is\n\\[\n\\E(u_t\\mid z_{t1}, z_{t2}) = 0\n\\] Importantly, the condition does NOT rule out correlation between, say, \\(u_{t-1}\\) and \\(z_{t1}\\). This type of correlation could arise if \\(z_{t1}\\) is related to past \\(y_{t-1}\\), such as\n\\[\nz_{t1} = \\delta_0 + \\delta_1y_{t-1} + v_t.\n\\] For example, \\(z_{t1}\\) might be a policy variable, such as monthly percentage change in the money supply, and this change might depend on last month’s rate of inflation (\\(y_{t-1}\\)). Such a mechanism generally causes \\(z_{t1}\\) and \\(u_{t-1}\\) to be correlated (as can be seen by plugging in for \\(y_{t-1}\\)). This kind of feedback is allowed under contemporaneous exogeneity.\n\nIn the social sciences, many explanatory variables may very well violate the strict exogeneity assumption. For example, the amount of labor input might not be strictly exogenous, as it is chosen by the farmer, and the farmer may adjust the amount of labor based on last year’s yield. Policy variables, such as growth in the money supply, expenditures on welfare, and highway speed limits, are often influenced by what has happened to the outcome variable in the past.\nThere are similar considerations in distributed lag models. Usually, we do not worry that \\(u_t\\) might be correlated with past \\(z\\) because we are controlling for past \\(z\\) in the model. But feedback from \\(u\\) to future \\(z\\) is always an issue.",

    "text": "11.2 Large sample properties of OLS\nUnder Assumptions 11.1 through 11.3, the OLS estimators are consistent: \\(\\mathrm{plim}\\, \\hat{\\beta}_j = \\beta_j,\\) \\(j=1,\\ldots,K.\\)\n\nOLS estimators are consistent, but not necessarily unbiased.\nWe have weakened the sense in which the explanatory variables must be exogenous, but weak dependence is required in the underlying time series.\n\n\nUnder Assumptions 11.1 through 11.5, the OLS estimators are asymptotically normally distributed. Further, the usual OLS standard errors, \\(t\\) statistics, \\(F\\) statistics, and \\(LM\\) statistics are asymptotically valid.\nModels with trending explanatory variables can effectively satisfy Assumptions 11.1 through 11.5, provided they are trend stationary. As long as time trends are included in the equations when needed, the usual inference procedures are asymptotically valid.\n\n\nExample 11.1 The AR(1) model cannot satisfy the strict exogeneity assumption (11.3).\nConsider the AR(1) model,\n\\[\ny_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1y_{t-1} + u_t,\n\\] where the error \\(u_t\\) has a zero expected value, given all past values of \\(y:\\)\n\\[\n\\E(u_t\\mid y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\\ldots)=0.\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nCombined, these two equations imply that\n\\[\n\\E(y_t\\mid y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\\ldots) = \\E(y_t\\mid y_{t-1}) =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1y_{t-1}.\n\\] It means that, once \\(y\\) lagged one period has been controlled for, no further lags of \\(y\\) affect the expected value of \\(y_t.\\)\nBecause \\(\\bx_t\\) contains only \\(y_{t-1},\\) Equation 11.1 implies that contemporaneous exogeneity holds.\nBy contrast, the strict exogeneity assumption is needed for unbiasedness. Since \\(u_t\\) is always correlated with \\(y_t\\) (\\(\\cov(u_t, y_t)=\\var(u_t)&gt;0\\)), strict exogeneity assumption cannot be true.\nTherefore, a model with a lagged dependent variable cannot satisfy the strict exogeneity assumption.\nFor the weak dependence of \\(y_t\\) to hold, we must assume that \\(\\abs{\\beta_1}&lt;1.\\) If this condition holds, then Assumptions 11.1 through 11.3 implies that the OLS estimator from the regression of \\(y_t\\) on \\(y_{t-1}\\) produces consistent estimators of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1.\\)\nUnfortunately, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) s biased, and this bias can be large if the sample size is small or if \\(\\beta_1\\) is near 1. For \\(\\beta_1\\) near 1, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) can have a severe downward bias. In moderate to large samples, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) should be a good estimator of \\(\\beta_1.\\)\n\n\nEquation 11.1 also indicates no serial correlation in \\(u_t.\\)\n\nProof. To show that the errors \\(\\{u_t\\}\\) are serially uncorrelated, we must show that \\(\\E(u_tu_s\\mid \\bx_t, \\bx_s)=0\\) for \\(t\\ne s.\\) The explanatory variable at \\(t\\) is \\(y_{t-1}\\), hence we need to prove\n\\[\n\\E(u_tu_s\\mid y_{t-1}, y_{s-1})=0\n\\] Assume \\(s&lt;t,\\) rewrite \\(u_s = y_s-beta_0-beta_1y_{s-1},\\) that is, \\(u_s\\) is a function of \\(y\\) dated before time \\(t.\\)\nBy Equation 11.1, we have\n\\[\n\\E(u_t\\mid u_s, y_{t-1}, y_{s-1}) = 0.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\phantom{=}\\E(u_tu_s \\mid u_s, y_{t-1}, y_{s-1} ) \\\\\n&= u_s\\E(u_t \\mid u_s, y_{t-1} , y_{s-1} )  \\quad (\\text{taking out what is known})\\\\\n&= 0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] By ILE (Law of Iterated Expectations),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\E(u_tu_s \\mid y_{t-1}, y_{s-1} )\n&= \\E \\left[\\E(u_tu_s \\mid u_s, y_{t-1}, y_{s-1} ) \\mid y_{t-1}, y_{s-1} \\right] = 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Conclusion: as long as only one lag of \\(y\\) appears in \\(\\E(y_t\\mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \\ldots)\\), the errors \\(\\{u_t\\}\\) must be serially uncorrelated.\n\n\n□\n\n\nExample 11.2 In a static model \\(y_t = \\beta_0+\\beta_1z_t+u_t,\\) the homoskedasticity assumption requires that\n\\[\n\\var(u_t\\mid z_t) = \\var(y_t\\mid z_t) = \\sigma^2.\n\\]\nIn the AR(1) model, \\(y_t = \\beta_0+\\beta_1y_{t-1}+u_t,\\) the homoskedasticity assumption is\n\\[\n\\var(u_t\\mid y_{t-1}) = \\var(y_t\\mid y_{t-1}) = \\sigma^2.\n\\] If we have the model\n\\[\ny_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1z_t + \\beta_2y_{t-1} + \\beta_3z_{t-1}+u_t,\n\\] the homoskedasticity assumption is\n\\[\n\\var(u_t\\mid z_t, y_{t-1}, z_{t-1}) = \\var(y_t\\mid z_t, y_{t-1}, z_{t-1}) = \\sigma^2,\n\\] so that the variance of \\(u_t\\) cannot depend on \\(z_t, y_{t-1},\\) or \\(z_{t-1}\\) (or some other function of time).\nGenerally, whatever explanatory variables appear in the model, we must assume that the variance of \\(y_t\\) given these explanatory variables is constant. If the model contains lagged \\(y\\) or lagged explanatory variables, then we are explicitly ruling out dynamic forms of heteroskedasticity. But, in a static model, we are only concerned with \\(\\var(y_t\\mid z_t).\\)",

    "text": "Provided the time series we use are weakly dependent, usual OLS inference procedures are valid under assumptions weaker than the classical linear model assumptions. Unfortunately, many economic time series cannot be characterized by weak dependence.\nUsing time series with strong dependence in regression analysis poses no problem, if the CLM assumptions in finite samples hold. But the usual inference procedures are very susceptible to violation of these assumptions when the data are not weakly dependent, because then we cannot appeal to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. In this section, we provide some examples of highly persistent (or strongly dependent) time series and show how they can be transformed for use in regression analysis.\nWhen the time series are highly persistent (they have unit roots), we must exercise extreme caution in using them directly in regression models. An alternative to using the levels is to use the first differences of the variables. For most highly persistent economic time series, the first difference is weakly dependent. Using first differences changes the nature of the model, but this method is often as informative as a model in levels. When data are highly persistent, we usually have more faith in first-difference results.",

    "text": "13.1 Finite Distributed Lags\nGiven the dynamic relationship of time series data, there are three different ways of modeling these relationships.\nWe can also combine the first two features of the above and previous equation so that we have a dynamic model with lagged values of both the dependent and independent variables, such as\n\\[\ny_t = f(y_{t-1}, x_t, x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \\ldots)\n\\]\nSuch models are called autoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL). As we have shown, the ARDL model is composed of an autoregressive component, which is the dependent variable regressed on one or more of its past values, and a distributed lag component, which is the independent variable and one or more of its lagged components.\nStationarity\nAn assumption that we will maintain throughout this exercise is that variables in our equation are stationary, which means that a variable is one that is not explosive, nor trending, and nor wandering aimlessly without returning to its mean. A stationary variable simply means a variable whose mean, variance and other statistical properties remain constant over time.\nThe first dynamic relationship we consider is the first model that we introduced, which took the form of\n\\(y_t = f(x_t, x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \\ldots)\\),\nwith the additional assumption that the relationship is linear, and after \\(q\\) time periods, changes in \\(x\\) no longer have an impact on \\(y\\). Under these conditions, we have the multiple regression model:\n\\[\ny_t = \\alpha + \\beta_0 x_t + \\beta_1 x_{t-1} + \\beta_2 x_{t-2} + \\ldots + \\beta_q x_{t-q} + e_t\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nThe above model can be treated in the same way as a multiple regression model. Instead of having a number of different explanatory variables, we have a number of different lags of the same explanatory variable. This equation can be very useful in two ways:\nThe effect of a one-unit change in \\(x_t\\) is distributed over the current and next \\(q\\) periods.\nIt is called a finite distributed lag model of order \\(q\\) because it is assumed that after a finite number of periods \\(q\\),\nchanges in \\(x\\) no longer have an impact on \\(y\\). The coefficient \\(\\beta_s\\) is called a distributed-lag weight or an \\(s\\)-period delayed multiplier.\nThe coefficient \\(\\beta_0\\) is called the impact multiplier.\nAdding up a portion of the coefficients gives you the interim multipliers.\nFor example, the interim multiplier for two periods would be \\((\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2)\\).\nThe total multiplier is the final effect on \\(y\\) on the sustained increase after \\(q\\) or more periods have elapsed and is given by the equation:\n\\[\n\\sum_{s=0}^q \\beta_s\n\\]",

Arther Melvin Okun was an economist who posited that higher output growth reduces unemployment. Mathematically, Okun’s Law can be expressed as\n\\[\nU_{t}-U_{t-1}=-\\gamma(G_{t}-G_{N})\n\\] where \\(U_{t}\\) is the unemployment rate in period \\(t\\), \\(G_{t}\\) is the growth rate of output in period \\(t\\), and \\(G_{N}\\) is the “normal” growth rate, which we assume constant over time.\nWe can rewrite the above equation in more familiar notation of the multiple regression model by denoting the change in unemployment as \\(DU_{t}=\\Delta U_{t}=U_{t}-U_{t-1}.\\) We then set \\(\\gamma = \\beta_{0}\\) and \\(G_{N} = \\alpha.\\) Including an error term to our equation yields\n\\[\nDU_{t}=\\alpha + \\beta_{0}G_{t} + \\varepsilon_{t}.\n\\]\nAcknowledging the changes in output are likely to have a distributed-lag effect on unemployment – not all of the effect will take place instantaneously.

For the procedure to have good properties, we should have large \\(N\\) and relatively small \\(T\\). We assume that we have a balanced panel, although the method can be extended to unbalanced panels.\nDeriving the GLS transformation that eliminates serial correlation in the errors requires sophisticated matrix algebra (see, for example, Wooldridge (2010, Chapter 10)). But the transformation itself is simple. Define \\[\n\\theta = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_u^2}{\\sigma_a^2 + T \\sigma_u^2} \\right]^{1/2},\n\\]\nwhich is between zero and one. As $ $ approaches zero, \\(\\theta\\to1.\\)\nThen, the transformed equation turns out to be \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{it} - \\theta \\overline{y}_i &= \\beta_0 (1 - \\theta) + \\beta_1 (x_{it1} - \\theta \\overline{x}_{i1}) + \\cdots \\\\\n&\\phantom{=}\\quad + \\beta_K (x_{itK} - \\theta \\overline{x}_{iK}) + (v_{it} - \\theta \\overline{v}_i),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{16.3}\\] where the overbar \\(\\overline{y}_i=T^{-1}\\sum_{t=1}^Ty_{it}\\) is the time averages of \\(y\\) for individual \\(i\\), and similarly for \\(\\overline{x}_{ij},\\) \\(j=1,\\ldots,K.\\)\nThis is a very interesting equation, as it involves quasi-demeaned data on each variable. The fixed effects estimator subtracts the time averages from the corresponding variable. The random effects transformation subtracts a fraction of that time average, where the fraction depends on \\(\\sigma_u^2,\\) \\(\\sigma_a^2\\) and the number of time periods, \\(T\\).\nThe GLS estimator is simply the pooled OLS estimator of Equation 16.3. The errors in Equation 16.3 are serially uncorrelated.\nThe transformation in Equation 16.3 allows for explanatory variables that are constant over time, and this is one advantage of random effects (RE) over either fixed effects or first differencing. This is possible because RE assumes that the unobserved effect is uncorrelated with all explanatory variables, whether the explanatory variables are fixed over time or not. Thus, in a wage equation, we can include a variable such as education even if it does not change over time. But we are assuming that education is uncorrelated with \\(a_i\\), which contains ability and family background. In many applications, the whole reason for using panel data is to allow the unobserved effect to be correlated with the explanatory variables.\nThe parameter \\(\\theta\\) is never known in practice, but it can always be estimated. There are different ways to do this, which may be based on pooled OLS or fixed effects, for example. Generally, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) takes the form \\[\n\\hat{\\theta} = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_u^2}{\\hat{\\sigma}_a^2 + T \\hat{\\sigma}_u^2} \\right]^{1/2},\n\\] where \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_a^2\\) is a consistent estimator of \\(\\sigma_a^2\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_u^2\\) is a consistent estimator of \\(\\sigma_u^2\\).\nThese estimators can be based on the pooled OLS or the fixed effects residuals. \\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}_a^2 = \\left[ \\frac{NT(T - 1)}{2} - (K + 1) \\right]^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \\sum_{s=t+1}^{T} \\hat{v}_{it} \\hat{v}_{is},\n\\] where the \\(\\hat{v}_{it}\\) are the residuals from estimating Equation 16.2 by pooled OLS.\nGiven this, we can estimate \\(\\sigma_u^2\\) by using \\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}_u^2 = \\hat{\\sigma}_v^2 - \\hat{\\sigma}_a^2,\n\\] where \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_v^2\\) is the square of the usual standard error of the regression from pooled OLS. [See Wooldridge (2010, Chapter 10) for additional discussion of these estimators.]\nThe feasible GLS estimator that uses \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) in place of \\(\\theta\\) is called the random effects estimator.\nUnder the random effects assumptions, the estimator is consistent (not unbiased) and asymptotically normally distributed as \\(N\\) gets large with fixed \\(T\\).\nThe properties of the random effects (RE) estimator with small \\(N\\) and large \\(T\\) are largely unknown, although it has certainly been used in such situations.\n\nComparing RE estimates and FE estimates: When \\(\\theta=1\\), RE becomes the FE model. Recall that \\[\n\\theta = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_u^2}{\\sigma_a^2 + T \\sigma_u^2} \\right]^{1/2},\n\\] There are three scenarios where \\(\\theta\\to1\\):\n\n\\(T\\) is big \\(\\rightarrow\\) Lots of variation across time for each individual \\(\\rightarrow\\) more like fixed effects\n\\(\\sigma_a^2\\) is big \\(\\rightarrow\\) Lots of variation in the fixed effects \\(\\rightarrow\\) more like fixed effects\n\\(\\sigma_u^2\\) is small relative to \\(\\sigma_a^2\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) idiosyncratic variation is small, more variation from fixed effects \\(\\rightarrow\\) more like fixed effects\n\nComparing RE estimates and Pooled OLS: When \\(\\theta=0\\), RE becomes the Pooled OLS. This happens when the unobserved effect, \\(a_i,\\) is relatively unimportant (because it has small variance relative to \\(\\sigma^2_u\\)).\n\nSummary of RE:\n\nRandom effects estimators are a weighted average of the between estimator (variation between individuals in a cross section) and the within/fixed estimator (variation within individuals over time)\nRandom effects estimators will be consistent and unbiased if fixed effects are not correlated with \\(\\bx\\)’s. Fixed effects estimators will always be consistent and unbiased (under usual GM assumptions)\nRandom effects estimators will be more efficient (have smaller standard errors) than fixed effects estimators because they use more of the variation in \\(X\\) (specifically, they use the cross sectional/between variation)",

    "text": "17.1.1 Introduction\nThroughout the previous section, we assumed that the idiosyncratic term \\(u_{it}\\) satisfied strict exogeneity with respect to the data: \\[\n    \\E[u_{it}|\\bX_i] = 0.\n\\tag{17.1}\\]\nHowever, strict exogeneity is not an innocent assumption. In particular, it implies that for all pairs of indices \\(s, t\\) it holds that \\[\n    \\E[u_{it}\\bx_{is}] =0.\n\\tag{17.2}\\]\nFor \\(t&lt;s\\), Equation 17.2 means that past shocks are uncorrelated with future values of \\(\\bx\\). In other words, one cannot predict past shocks from future \\(\\bx\\)s.\nThis requirement might fail if \\(\\bx\\) is dynamic and its evolution is affected by \\(u_{it}\\). In this section, we will discuss this challenge and some traditional approaches to dealing with it with short panel data.\n\n\n17.1.2 No Strict Exogeneity In the Presence of Lagged Dependent Variables\nConsider the AR(1) model, \\[\ny_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t,\n\\tag{17.3}\\] where the error \\(u_t\\) has a zero expected value, given all past values of \\(y\\): \\[\n\\mathbb{E}(u_t \\mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \\ldots) = 0.\n\\tag{17.4}\\]\nCombined, these two equations imply that \\[\n\\mathbb{E}(y_t \\mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \\ldots) = \\mathbb{E}(y_t \\mid y_{t-1}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 y_{t-1}.\n\\]\nThis result is very important. First, it means that, once \\(y\\) lagged one period has been controlled for, no further lags of \\(y\\) affect the expected value of \\(y_t\\). (This is where the name “first order” originates.) Second, the relationship is assumed to be linear.\nBecause \\(x_t\\) contains only \\(y_{t-1}\\), Equation 17.4 implies that the contemporaneous exogeneity Assumption holds. By contrast, the strict exogeneity assumption needed for unbiasedness, which does not hold.\nIn fact, because \\(u_t\\) is uncorrelated with \\(y_{t-1}\\) under Equation 17.4, \\(u_t\\) and \\(y_t\\) must be correlated.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Cov}(y_t, u_t) &= \\text{Cov}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t, u_t) \\\\\n&= \\text{Var}(u_t) &gt; 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore, a model with a lagged dependent variable cannot satisfy the strict exogeneity assumption.\nFor the weak dependence condition to hold, we must assume that \\(|\\beta_1| &lt; 1\\). If this condition holds, then the OLS estimator from the regression of \\(y_t\\) on \\(y_{t-1}\\) produces consistent estimators of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nUnfortunately, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1^{OLS}\\) is biased, and this bias can be large if the sample size is small or if \\(\\beta_1\\) is near 1. (For \\(\\beta_1\\) near 1, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1^{OLS}\\) can have a severe downward bias.) In moderate to large samples, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1^{OLS}\\) should be a good estimator of \\(\\beta_1\\).\nEquation 17.4 is called the sequential exogeneity assumption.",

To prove this, we can show that \\(\\E[\\Delta y_{it-1} \\Delta u_{it}] \\ne 0.\\)\nPlug in \\(\\Delta y_{it-1} = y_{it-1}-y_{it-2}\\) and \\(\\Delta u_{it} = u_{it}-u_{it-1}.\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\E[\\Delta y_{it-1} \\Delta u_{it}]\n&= \\E[(y_{it-1}-y_{it-2})(u_{it}-u_{it-1})] \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{\\E[y_{it-1}u_{it}]}_{0} - \\underbrace{\\E[y_{it-2}u_{it}]}_0 - \\E[y_{it-1}u_{it-1}] + \\underbrace{\\E[y_{it-2}u_{it-1}]}_0 \\\\\n&= -\\E[y_{it-1}u_{it-1}] \\\\\n&= -\\E[(\\alpha_i + \\lambda y_{it-2} + u_{it-1}) u_{it-1}] \\\\\n&= -\\E[u_{it-1}^2] \\\\\n&= -\\sigma_u^2 \\ne 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHence we conclude that\n\\[\n\\E[\\Delta y_{it-1} \\Delta u_{it}] \\ne 0,\n\\] and that \\(\\Delta y_{it-1}\\) is an endogeneous regressor in the differenced Equation 17.7.\n\n17.2.1 IV Estimator of Dynamic Panel Models\nGiven the endogeneity issue in first-differencing, instrumental variable methods offer a potential solution. We only need to find suitable instruments – variables \\(z_{it}\\) which satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\E[z_{it}\\Delta y_{it-1}] \\neq 0,\\\\\n    \\E[z_{it}\\Delta u_{it}] = 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn most contexts, one has to look for external variables that can serve as instruments.\nHowever, model (17.7) is a very special case where one can use instruments internal to the model!\n\n17.2.1.1 The Anderson-Hsiao Estimator\nIn particular, consider using twice lagged level of dependent variable \\(y_{it-2}\\) as an instrument for \\(\\Delta y_{it-1}.\\)\n\nRelevance seems to be relatively straightforward, as the target endogenous variable \\(\\Delta y_{it-1} = y_{it-1}-y_{it-2}\\) actually has the instrument inside.\n\\[\n  \\E[y_{it-2}\\Delta y_{it-1}] = \\E[y_{it-2}(y_{it-1}-y_{it-2})] \\ne 0.\n  \\]\n\\(y_{it-2}\\) is correlated with the endogenous variable \\(\\Delta y_{it-1}.\\)\nExogeneity can be justified by appealing to sequential exogeneity:\n\\[  \n  \\E[y_{it-2}\\Delta u_{it}]  = \\E[y_{it-2}u_{it} - y_{it-2}u_{it-1}]=0.\n  \\] \\(y_{it-2}\\) is not correlated with the error term \\(\\Delta u_{it}.\\)\n\nHence \\(y_{it-2}\\) is a valid instrument!\nThe resulting IV estimator is known as the Anderson and Hsiao (1982) estimator and given by \\[\n\\hat{\\lambda}^{AH} = \\dfrac{ \\sum_{t=2}^T y_{it-2}\\Delta y_{it} }{\\sum_{t=2}^T y_{it-2}\\Delta y_{it-1} }.\n\\]",

    "text": "18.1.1 Models with Homogeneous Slopes\nWe begin our journey where standard textbooks and first-year foundational courses in econometrics leave off. The “standard” linear models considered in such courses often assume homogeneity in individual responses to covariates (e.g., Hansen (2022)). A common cross-sectional specification is:\n\\[\ny_i = \\bbeta'\\bx_i + u_{i},\n\\tag{18.1}\\] where \\(i=1, \\dots, N\\) indexes cross-sectional units.\nIn panel data, models often include unit-specific \\((i)\\) and time-specific \\((t)\\) intercepts while maintaining a common slope vector \\(\\bbeta\\):\n\\[\ny_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\delta_t +  \\bbeta'\\bx_{it} + u_{it}.\n\\tag{18.2}\\]\n\n\n18.1.2 Heterogeneity in Slopes.\nHowever, modern economic theory rarely supports the assumption of homogeneous slopes \\(\\bbeta.\\) Theoretical models recognize that observationally identical individuals, firms, and countries can respond differently to the same stimulus. In a linear model, this requires us to consider more flexible models with heterogeneous coefficients:\n\nCross-sectional model (18.1) generalizes to\n\\[\ny_i = \\bbeta_{i}'\\bx + u_i.\n\\tag{18.3}\\]\nPanel data model (18.2) generalizes to\n\\[\ny_{it}  = \\bbeta_{it}'\\bx_{it} + u_{it}.\n\\tag{18.4}\\]\n\nSuch models are worth studying, as they naturally arise in a variety of contexts:\n\nStructural models with parametric restrictions: Certain parametric restrictions yield linear relationships in coefficients. An example is given by firm-level Cobb-Douglas production functions where firm-specific productivity differences induce heterogeneous coefficients (Combes et al. (2012); Sury (2011)).\nBinary covariates and interaction terms: if all covariates are binary and all interactions are included, a linear model encodes all treatment effects without loss of generality (see, e.g., Wooldridge (2005)).\nLog-linearized models: Nonlinear models may be approximated by linear models around a steady-state. For example, Heckman and Vytlacil (1998) demonstrate how the nonlinear Card (2001) education model simplifies to a heterogeneous linear specification after linearization.",
