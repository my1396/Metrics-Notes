## Exogeneity and Dynamic Models

### Introduction

Throughout the previous section, we assumed that the idiosyncratic term $u_{it}$ satisfied strict exogeneity with respect to the data:
$$
	\E[u_{it}|\bX_i] = 0.
$${#eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality}

However, strict exogeneity is not an innocent assumption. In particular, it implies that for all pairs of indices $s, t$ it holds that 
$$
	\E[u_{it}\bx_{is}] =0.
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality}

For $t<s$, @eq-dynamic-interlude-strict-orthogonality means that *past* shocks are uncorrelated with *future* values of $\bx$.  In other words, one cannot predict *past* shocks from *future* $\bx$s. 

This requirement might fail if $\bx$ is dynamic and its evolution is affected by $u_{it}$. In this section, we will discuss this challenge and some traditional approaches to dealing with it with short panel data. 


### No Strict Exogeneity In the Presence of Lagged Dependent Variables

Consider the AR(1) model,
$$
y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t, 
$$ {#eq-AR1}
where the error $u_t$ has a zero expected value, given all past values of $y$:
$$
\mathbb{E}(u_t \mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \ldots) = 0. 
$$ {#eq-zero_mean}

Combined, these two equations imply that
$$
\mathbb{E}(y_t \mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \ldots) = \mathbb{E}(y_t \mid y_{t-1}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1}. 
$$

This result is very important. First, it means that, once $y$ lagged one period has been controlled for, no further lags of $y$ affect the expected value of $y_t$. (This is where the name “first order” originates.) Second, the relationship is assumed to be linear.

Because $x_t$ contains only $y_{t-1}$, @eq-zero_mean implies that the **contemporaneous exogeneity** Assumption holds. By contrast, the strict exogeneity assumption needed for unbiasedness, which does not hold. 

In fact, because $u_t$ is uncorrelated with $y_{t-1}$ under @eq-zero_mean, $u_t$ and $y_t$ must be correlated.  

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Cov}(y_t, u_t) &= \text{Cov}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t, u_t) \\
&= \text{Var}(u_t) > 0.
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Therefore, a model with a lagged dependent variable cannot satisfy the strict exogeneity assumption.

For the weak dependence condition to hold, we must assume that $|\beta_1| < 1$. If this condition holds, then the OLS estimator from the regression of $y_t$ on $y_{t-1}$ produces **consistent** estimators of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 

Unfortunately, $\hat{\beta}_1^{OLS}$ is **biased**, and this *bias can be large if the sample size is small* or if $\beta_1$ is *near* 1. (For $\beta_1$ near 1, $\hat{\beta}_1^{OLS}$ can have a severe downward bias.) In moderate to large samples, $\hat{\beta}_1^{OLS}$ should be a good estimator of $\beta_1$.

@eq-zero_mean is called the **sequential exogeneity** assumption.


## Dynamic Panel Representation

More generally, consider a panel data linear model with homogeneous coefficients, a random intercept, and a dynamic process for the outcome:
$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{k=1}^K \lambda_k y_{it-k} + \bbeta'\bx_{it} + u_{it}.  
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-panel}
In this model, a sequential exogeneity assumption takes form
$$
	 \E[u_{it}\mid \curl{y_{is-1}, \bx_{is}}_{s\leq t}] =0. 
$$

For the sake of simplicity, we will discuss a simple version of model ([-@eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-panel]) without extra covariates $\bx_{it}$ and with only one lag of $y_{it}$:
$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \lambda y_{it-1} + u_{it}, 
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-simple}
where $u_{it}$ satisfies sequential exogeneity in the form $\E[u_{it}|y_{is}, s<t] = 0$. 


Let us difference @eq-dynamic-interlude-dynamic-simple across $t$ to eliminate the random intercept $\alpha_i$. The differenced equation takes form

$$
\Delta y_{it} = \lambda \Delta y_{it-1} + \Delta u_{it},
$$ {#eq-dynamic-interlude-homogeneous-differenced}

where $\Delta y_{it} = y_{it} - y_{it-1}.$
@eq-dynamic-interlude-homogeneous-differenced seems like a simple regression equation. It is tempting to just apply OLS and regress $\Delta y_{it}$ on $\Delta y_{it-1}$. But it turns out that @eq-dynamic-interlude-homogeneous-differenced has an endogeneity problem. To prove this, we can show that $\E[\Delta y_{it-1} \Delta u_{it}] \ne 0.$

Plug in $\Delta y_{it-1} = y_{it-1}-y_{it-2}$ and $\Delta u_{it} = u_{it}-u_{it-1}.$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\E[\Delta y_{it-1} \Delta u_{it}] 
&= \E[(y_{it-1}-y_{it-2})(u_{it}-u_{it-1})] \\
&= \underbrace{\E[y_{it-1}u_{it}]}_{0} - \underbrace{\E[y_{it-2}u_{it}]}_0 - \E[y_{it-1}u_{it-1}] + \underbrace{\E[y_{it-2}u_{it-1}]}_0 \\
&= -\E[y_{it-1}u_{it-1}] \\
&= -\E[(\alpha_i + \lambda y_{it-2} + u_{it-1}) u_{it-1}] \\
&= -\E[u_{it-1}^2] \\
&= -\sigma_u^2 \ne 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence we conclude that 

$$
\E[\Delta y_{it-1} \Delta u_{it}] \ne 0,
$$
and that $\Delta y_{it-1}$ is an endogeneous regressor in the differenced @eq-dynamic-interlude-homogeneous-differenced.

### IV Estimator of Dynamic Panel Models

Given the endogeneity issue in first-differencing, instrumental variable methods offer a potential solution. We only need to find suitable instruments -- variables $z_{it}$ which satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions:
$$
\begin{aligned}
	\E[z_{it}\Delta y_{it-1}] \neq 0,\\
	\E[z_{it}\Delta u_{it}] = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$


In most contexts, one has to look for external variables that can serve as instruments.

However, model  ([-@eq-dynamic-interlude-homogeneous-differenced]) is a very special case where one can use instruments internal to the model! 

#### The Anderson-Hsiao Estimator

In particular, consider using twice lagged level of dependent variable $y_{it-2}$ as an instrument for $\Delta y_{it-1}.$ 

- **Relevance** seems to be relatively straightforward, as the target endogenous variable $\Delta y_{it-1} = y_{it-1}-y_{it-2}$ actually has the instrument inside.

    $$
    \E[y_{it-2}\Delta y_{it-1}] = \E[y_{it-2}(y_{it-1}-y_{it-2})] \ne 0.
    $$
    
    $y_{it-2}$ is correlated with the endogenous variable $\Delta y_{it-1}.$

- **Exogeneity** can be justified by appealing to sequential exogeneity: 

    $$	
    \E[y_{it-2}\Delta u_{it}]  = \E[y_{it-2}u_{it} - y_{it-2}u_{it-1}]=0. 
    $$
    $y_{it-2}$ is not correlated with the error term $\Delta u_{it}.$


Hence $y_{it-2}$ is a valid instrument! 

The resulting IV estimator is known as the @Anderson1982 estimator and given by
$$
\hat{\lambda}^{AH} = \dfrac{ \sum_{t=2}^T y_{it-2}\Delta y_{it} }{\sum_{t=2}^T y_{it-2}\Delta y_{it-1} }.
$$
